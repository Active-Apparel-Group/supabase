# Supabase Monorepo Modules

This folder contains modular subprojects for the Supabase backend, organized for clarity and scalability:

- **01-pim/**: Product Information Management (PIM)
- **02-timeline/**: Timeline and Scheduling
- **03-forecasting/**: Forecasting and Analytics
- **docs/**: Module-specific documentation and workflow plans

Each module contains its own `docs/`, `edge-functions/`, and `sql/` directories for separation of concerns.
